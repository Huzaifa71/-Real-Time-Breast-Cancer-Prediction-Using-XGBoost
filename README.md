## **Project Overview**  
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project uses machine learning to classify tumors as malignant or benign, providing a tool for faster and more accurate diagnosis.  

---

## **Key Steps**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables.  
   - Used **SMOTE** to address class imbalance, ensuring balanced learning.  

2. **Feature Selection**:  
   - Selected the most relevant features for accurate predictions.  

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**:  
   - Trained **16 machine learning models** (see below).  
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
   - **XGBoost** emerged as the best-performing model with **99% accuracy**.  

4. **Cross-Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning**:  
   - Performed **5-fold cross-validation** for robust performance.  
   - Fine-tuned XGBoost using **RandomizedSearchCV**, achieving **97.9% accuracy** on the test set.  

5. **Feature Importance Analysis**:  
   - Used **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to identify key features driving predictions.
